# Google Chrome toolkit

This project is a toolkit for Google Chrome to perform various operations that are not available in Chrome or tedious to do manually.
Currently, there are two use-cases: 
* Export browser history to various formats including CSV, HTML and simple text file. The history is read from Chrome's sqlite DB.
* Save open tabs to a text file from a connected Android device via adb.

### Getting started / Setup

You need to have python 3.8 and pip installed.
Run make from the project's root directory, all python dependencies required by the project will be installed.

Additional steps

Make sure to have proper PYTHONPATH, this needs to be in the path: 
```
<project-root-dir>/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
```

Example
```
echo $PYTHONPATH
/Users/snemeth/Library/Python/3.8/lib/python/site-packages/:/Users/snemeth/.asdf/installs/python/3.8.12/lib/python3.8/site-packages:/Users/snemeth/.linuxenv//scripts/python/:/Users/snemeth/development/my-repos/google-chrome-toolkit/venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/
```

Launch with command from main dir: 
```
python3 main.py
```
